"""`aiter.topk_select`: the dispatched per-row top-k, against its four backends.

Two halves. The sweep times `topk_select` beside every backend that can serve
the shape, so the dispatch can be read off the table rather than trusted; a row
where `topk_select` is far off the best column is a threshold that has moved.

The invariants are the other half, and they are the part a value comparison
cannot reach. Three bugs in this entry were silent -- an offset applied before
the gather, a row range handed to the backend that reads it as a whole-row
selection, and a `sorted_index` that reordered the indices without the values --
and all three returned plausible tensors. Each has an assertion here.
