"""MXFP4 paged MQA logits for DeepSeek-style sparse attention (OPUS kernels), gfx950 and gfx1250.

Per query row ``r`` over a window ``[s, e)``:
``out[r, s:e] = sum_H( relu(Q[r] . K^T) * weight[r] ) * weight_scale``

Prefill and decode share one launch over a per-tile schedule built on device. The plan depends
only on per-forward data, so build it once per forward and reuse it for every CSA layer::

    width = pa_mqa_logits_mxfp4_block_table_width(max_model_len)          # once at startup
    buf  = pa_mqa_logits_mxfp4_plan_buffers(dev, total_q, batch,         # once per pool
                                            variant="qlen1_kv64")
    plan = pa_mqa_logits_mxfp4_plan(cu_seq_q, local_ends, buffers=buf)    # once per forward
    out  = pa_mqa_logits_mxfp4(q, q_scale, kv_cache, kv_scale,            # once per layer
                               block_tables, weights, plan, max_seq_len, out=out)

Every step is device-side with no readback, so the path is CUDAGraph-safe provided the buffers
are caller-held and reused (see :func:`pa_mqa_logits_mxfp4_plan`).

KERNEL INSTANCES (:func:`pa_mqa_logits_mxfp4_variants`) take identical inputs and are chosen
per buffer pool, never inferred from the shape. On gfx1250 the default suits prefill and
MTP > 1; MTP = 1 decode should ask for ``qlen1_kv64``.

LAYOUTS are the caller's; this module never touches the data:

=============  =======================================  =================================
tensor         gfx950                                   gfx1250
=============  =======================================  =================================
``q``          ``[total_q, H, D/2]`` uint8              same
``weights``    ``[total_q, H]`` bf16                    same
``q_scale``    ``[total_q, 2, 32, 4]`` MFMA-permuted    ``[total_q, H, 4]`` natural
``kv_scale``   ``[num_blocks, 2, 32, 4]`` permuted      ``[num_blocks, PAGE, 4]`` natural
``kv_cache``   ``[num_blocks, 4, PAGE, 16]``            ``[num_blocks, PAGE, D/2]`` natural
=============  =======================================  =================================

On gfx1250 each scale is the plain E8M0 byte of one 32-element K block, and each packed row is
64 contiguous bytes, low nibble first. Both layouts have the same byte count, so the C++
launchers (which check ``numel``) would accept the wrong one and return plausible wrong logits;
the ndim check here is the only guard, and it cannot catch an array reshaped to the right ndim.

FOUR CONDITIONS the kernel cannot check:

1. the window rule is non-decreasing in the row index within a tile (true of every causal and
   CSA-compressed rule), so a tile's union is its first row's start and last row's end. If
   broken, a CTA's waves disagree on the trip count and DEADLOCK;
2. stores are bounded only by the window, so a ``local_ends`` entry past ``out.shape[1]``
   writes past the row -- padding rows included;
3. a row that belongs to no live sequence (a CUDAGraph pad row) carries an EMPTY window
   (``local_ends <= local_starts``), and only such a row may have a negative ``row_to_batch``.
   At ``q_per_block == 1`` ``cu_seq_q`` is not consulted, so this is what keeps a pad row from
   reading ``q`` or ``block_tables``;
4. at ``q_per_block > 1`` ``cu_seq_q[batch] <= total_q``. The tile cut reads ``cu_seq_q`` on
   device and the builder then reads every tiled row's ``local_ends`` / ``local_starts`` /
   ``row_to_batch``, so a ``cu_seq_q`` claiming more rows than ``total_q`` reads those arrays
   past ``total_q``. Claiming fewer is fine: rows past ``cu_seq_q[batch]`` are not scheduled.

    ``cu_seq_q`` is the ``[batch + 1]`` query-row prefix sum. At ``q_per_block > 1`` tiles are
    cut from it so each holds rows of one batch only (the kernel would deadlock otherwise). At
    ``q_per_block == 1`` it is not consulted and the row domain is ``total_q``, not
    ``cu_seq_q[batch]``.

    ``local_ends`` is the per-row window end, ``[total_q]``; ``total_q`` defaults to its
    ``numel`` (pass it when ``local_ends`` is longer than ``q``). ``local_starts=None`` means
    every row starts at 0. Windows must meet the module docstring's conditions.

    ``row_to_batch`` maps each row to its ``block_tables`` row; ``None`` means ``block_tables``
    is indexed per query row. Mixing per-sequence and per-row conventions silently reads wrong
    pages. Negative ids are allowed only on empty-window rows. A tile reads ONE ``block_tables``
    row, its first row's: at ``q_per_block > 1`` with ``None``, every row of a sequence must
