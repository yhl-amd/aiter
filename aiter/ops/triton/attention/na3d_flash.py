"""3D neighborhood flash attention launcher.

Each query token at grid position (t, h, w) attends to the KT x KH x KW neighborhood
centered on it, with inward border-shift so every window has exactly KT x KH x KW keys.

Usage::

    from aiter.ops.triton.attention.na3d_flash import na3d_flash_attn

    out = na3d_flash_attn(q, k, v, kernel_size=(11, 11, 11))
    # q, k, v: (B, T, H, W, NH, HD) bfloat16, Q already scaled by head_dim**-0.5
    # out    : (B, T, H, W, NH, HD) bfloat16

    Args:
        q, k, v     : ``(B, T, H, W, NH, HD)`` bfloat16, channels-last.
                      Q is expected to be pre-scaled by ``head_dim ** -0.5``.
        kernel_size : ``(KT, KH, KW)`` neighborhood window.

    Returns:
        Output tensor ``(B, T, H, W, NH, HD)`` bfloat16.

    Supported domain (all asserted):
        - Device : running arch in ``{gfx942, gfx950}``; q/k/v on the current
          CUDA/HIP device.
        - dtype  : ``bfloat16`` for q, k, and v (shared).
        - Shape  : k and v match q's ``(B, T, H, W, NH, HD)``.
        - head_dim ``HD`` : power of two and ``>= 16`` (``tl.dot`` needs matrix
          dims of at least 16).
        - Window : ``0 < KT <= T``, ``0 < KH <= H``, ``0 < KW <= W``.
        - Width  : ``W >= 16`` (the smallest configured ``BLOCK_Q``).  ``KW <= 33``,
          and ``KW > 17`` additionally requires ``W >= 32`` -- large KW is served
          only by the ``BLOCK_Q=32/BLOCK_KV=64`` config, whose ``BLOCK_KV`` must
          cover ``BLOCK_Q + KW - 1``.

    Notes:
        **Inference / forward-pass only.** No autograd backward is implemented.
        Inputs with ``requires_grad=True`` will produce an output that is detached
        from the autograd graph, silently dropping gradients.

        Tensors are consumed in their native ``(B, T, H, W, NH, HD)`` layout; a
        ``contiguous()`` copy is made only for an input not already contiguous in
        that order.  The tile (BLOCK_Q, BLOCK_KV, num_warps, num_stages) is read
        from the per-arch config file (no runtime autotune).
