A hand-written Triton 2-D convolution library optimized for AMD RDNA
GPUs. Six kernel families (1×1, direct NCHW 3×3, 3×3 cblocked, 3×3
NHWC, Winograd F(4×4, 3×3), general) behind one shape-driven router and one entry
point. Drop-in for the forward path of `nn.Conv2d`.

The package also provides Conv3D for video-VAE workloads, organized into public
routing, launch, prepack, utility, and kernel layers. Dimension-specific
functions retain explicit names, and Conv3D uses independent packing caches and
routing logic.

---

## Why this op exists

PyTorch on AMD goes through MIOpen, which ships hand-tuned solvers per
architecture, per dtype, per layout. That works well on the combinations
the solvers were specifically tuned for, but every new dtype × layout ×
architecture combination needs its own tuning pass — so coverage is
uneven across the matrix (e.g. on RDNA4 the fp16 path is well-served,
while bf16 falls back to direct/GEMM solvers that are noticeably slower
at large channel counts; most modern checkpoints — LLMs, diffusion VAEs
— ship in bf16).

This op takes the opposite approach: a single set of Triton kernels
that runs **fp16 and bf16 through the same code path**, supports
**both NCHW and NHWC end-to-end** (channels-last inputs stay channels-last;
an ordinary contiguous input requested with `layout="nhwc"` is converted once),
and gets reasonable performance across the
full matrix **without per-architecture kernel implementations** (one
set of Triton kernels for every arch, with a thin per-arch JSON config
layer). A shape-driven
router picks between six kernel families so the right kernel runs per layer
automatically. Weight transforms are LRU-cached. Tuned NCHW 3×3 activations
can be read directly; other eligible shapes use one fused Triton NCHWc pack.

---

## Quick start

### Use the function directly

```python
import torch
from aiter.ops.triton.conv.conv2d import conv2d

x = torch.randn(4, 256, 56, 56, device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)
w = torch.randn(512, 256, 3, 3, device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)

y = conv2d(
    x, w, bias=None,
    stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1), dilation=(1, 1),
    activation="relu",          # "none" | "relu" | "relu6" | "gelu"
    layout="nchw",              # "nchw" or "nhwc"
)
```

### Conv3D

```python
import torch
from aiter.ops.triton.conv.conv3d import conv3d

x = torch.randn(1, 384, 3, 46, 51, device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)
w = torch.randn(384, 384, 3, 3, 3, device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)

y = conv3d(
    x, w, bias=None,
    stride=1, padding=1, dilation=1,
    activation="none",
    layout="ncdhw",           # "ncdhw" or "ndhwc"
)
```

The Conv3D router selects among specialized 1×1×1, NCDHWc 3×3×3, NDHWC
3×3×3, general im2col-free, and two 2.5-D Winograd input paths. The Winograd
paths transform only H/W with F(4×4,3×3) and perform the three depth taps
directly; one reads NCDHW and the other first packs input to NCDHWc. This avoids
the numerical amplification and temporary size of full 3-D Winograd. Weight
packs and filter transforms are version-aware LRU cached.

### Conv2D routing

A shape-driven router picks one of six kernel families:

| Family | When it runs |
|---|---|
| 1×1 GEMM | `R==1, S==1` with unit dilation |
| Direct NCHW 3×3 | Tuned NCHW shapes selected by a crossover or exact-route table; no input repack |
| 3×3 cblocked (NCHW) | Eligible NCHW shapes not routed direct; uses a fused NCHWc pack |
| 3×3 NHWC | 3×3 with channels-last input — no input repack |
| Winograd F(4×4, 3×3) | Eligible non-wave32 targets where transforms amortize |
| General | All other kernels, plus narrow-channel NCHW 3×3 |

### Use as `nn.Conv2d` drop-in

The kernel families above are functional; wrapping them in an `nn.Module`
(walk a model, swap each `nn.Conv2d` for a Triton-backed module that
calls `conv2d(...)` in its `forward`) works as expected and produces
images visually indistinguishable from the PyTorch / MIOpen reference.

Pixel-level agreement on FLUX.2-klein-9B (50 diffusion steps, same prompt
and seed under both backends, only VAE convs swapped to Triton): max diff
**6 / 255**, mean diff **0.17 / 255**.

---

## Constraints

- Only `groups=1` is implemented; callers must send depthwise or grouped
  convolutions to another backend.
- Only zero padding is implemented. Per-axis pad amounts may differ, for
  example `(0, 2)` for Conv2D or `(0, 1, 2)` for Conv3D, but callers must send
  `"reflect"`, `"replicate"`, and `"circular"` padding modes to PyTorch/MIOpen.
- Inputs must be `fp16` or `bf16`.
- Forward only (no backward / training).

## Reproducing the tests and benchmarks

Run these commands from the AITER repository root.

### Tests

Numerical Conv2D and Conv3D tests are CI-collected and skip at module level on
unsupported GPU architectures. The Conv3D configuration tests do not launch
kernels.

```bash
python -m pytest op_tests/triton_tests/conv/                       # all Conv1D/2D/3D tests
python -m pytest op_tests/triton_tests/conv/test_conv2d.py         # Conv2D tests
python -m pytest op_tests/triton_tests/conv/test_conv2d.py \
  -k "no_bias and fp16_nchw"                                      # no-bias FP16 NCHW tests
python -m pytest op_tests/triton_tests/conv/test_conv2d.py \
  -k "test_edge"                                                  # edge-case tests
```

The Conv2D tests are parametrized over `(dtype, layout, method)`. Every kernel in
`_helpers.ORDERED_METHODS` is exercised against fp16 and bf16 on NCHW.
NHWC is single-dispatch (only `conv2d_nhwc`), so each NHWC test runs once
per dtype.

The complete Conv3D suite contains numerical, routing, prepack, cache,
validation, and installed-configuration tests. Run it with:

```bash
python -m pytest op_tests/triton_tests/conv/test_conv3d.py
```

Benchmark execution and its command-line interface are provided separately by
`op_tests/op_benchmarks/triton/bench_conv3d.py`.

### Benchmark

The Conv2D benchmark has three modes, all in `bench_conv2d.py`.

**Single shape** (one parseable result line — for ad-hoc measurements):

```bash
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv2d \
    --N 1 --C 64 --H 56 --W 56 --K 64 --R 3 --S 3 --pad-h 1 --pad-w 1
```

**Real-model sweep** (default — uses ResNet50 if no `--model` given):

```bash
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv2d --dtype fp16              # default = resnet50
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv2d --model resnet50
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv2d --model "FLUX.2-klein-9B" --miopen-solvers
```

**Edge-case smoke sweep** (degenerate paths: `C=1`, dilation>1, asymmetric dims —
NOT representative of production):

```bash
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv2d --dtype fp16 --smoke
```

The Conv3D benchmark uses the same frozen-shape-database approach as Conv2D.
It defaults to the Wan2.2 A14B-style VAE workload and accepts a
case-insensitive model-name substring with `--model`:

```bash
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv3d                         # Wan2.2 A14B-style
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv3d --model ltx25
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv3d --model vision-patch
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv3d --model ti2v
```

The available Conv3D databases are `wan22-a14b-vae`, `ltx25-conv-vae`,
`vision-patch-embed`, and `wan22-ti2v-5b-vae`. VAE sweeps report per-shape
results, mean/median/aggregate performance, layer winners, and call-count-
weighted encoder/decoder totals when the trace provides those counts. The
benchmark always calls the production `conv3d` router unless `--method`
explicitly forces another supported path. `--batch-size N` overrides the batch
dimension across a model sweep.

The LTX trace uses the documented 121-frame 544×960 workload (latent
`[1,128,16,17,30]`). The Wan TI2V trace uses 121 frames at 704×1280 (latent
`[1,48,31,44,80]`) and includes both first-chunk and steady-state causal-cache
calls. `vision-patch-embed` covers InternVideo2 and Qwen-family tubelet/patch
projection shapes.

As with Conv2D, `--smoke` selects a compact edge-case sweep instead of a model:

```bash
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv3d --smoke
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv3d --model ltx25
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv3d --model ti2v --batch-size 2
```

For a single shape, provide the nine NCDHW/OIDHW dimensions. Depth, height, and
width parameters remain independent:

```bash
python -m op_tests.op_benchmarks.triton.bench_conv3d \
  --shape 1 64 4 16 16 128 1 1 1 \
  --stride 1 1 1 --padding 0 0 0 --dilation 1 1 1
```

--batch-size N                                # override N for every swept shape
--shape N C D H W K T R S                     # benchmark one shape
--stride SD SH SW                             # single-shape stride
--padding PD PH PW                            # single-shape padding
--dilation DD DH DW                           # single-shape dilation
-o, --output                                  # save results as CSV
